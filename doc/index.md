# API design guidelines

Status: **DRAFT**

This documentation aims to define a set of rules and principles for the design of public APIs.

## Philosophy

>Design decisions in an API are front and center, shown to all of the users of the API. Since this seriously limits our ability to make incremental improvements on our designs, relying on existing patterns that have survived the tests of time is very valuable in getting things right the first time rather than just eventually.

## Literature
